# ü§µÔ∏è Ankit Kumar Singh

Hi, I am a graduate student at R.V. College of Engineering, Bengaluru pursuing my Bachelors in Information Technology. I am passionate for Front-End Web Design and have extensive experience working with Deep Learning Models as well. I am always eager to learn and adapt to different environments.  

I can usually be found doing two things:
- Binge watching TV-shows/movies, or
- Coding (Learning as of now üòúÔ∏è). 

I'm currently learning Computer Vision and also, Web Development with React. As soon as I'm good with these two, I will get my hands dirty with Cloud Computing.
